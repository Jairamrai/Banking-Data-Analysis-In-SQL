# Banking-Data-Analysis
This is SQL end to end project

In this project, I analyzed customer transactions, branch performance, and demographic trends to uncover actionable insights. Key outcomes included identifying 30% inactive accounts and proposing re-engagement strategies, ranking branches based on deposits to improve resource allocation, and designing a fraud detection model that identified 98% of suspicious transactions. This project enhanced my skills in data querying, analysis, and driving data-driven decision-making.
